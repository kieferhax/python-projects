# “Are we there yet?” is a phrase that has existed for as long as there are children, vehicles, and road trips.
# First, ask the user “Are we there yet?” using the input() function and store it in an answer variable.
answer = input('Are we there yet? ')
# Then, use a while loop that asks the user “Are we there yet?” over and over again until they respond with a “Yes”.
while answer != 'yes':
  answer = input('Are we there yet? ')
