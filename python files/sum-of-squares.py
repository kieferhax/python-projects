#A number is "squared" when it is either multiplied by itself or taken to the second power (e.g., 4Â² = 4 x 4 = 16).
# First, ask the user for an integer with int(input()) and store it in a number variable. Then, define a total variable with an initial value of 0.
num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
total = 0
# Next, use a for loop and range() function to calculate the total of the squares of all integers from 1 to that number.
for i in range(1, num+1):
  total += i**2
  print(total)
# Last, print the output as an integer value.
# For example, if number is 5, the total should be 55 because:
# 1**2+2**2+3**2+4**2+5**2
# = 1+4+9+16+25
# = 55
