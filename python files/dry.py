# Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:
# Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
# Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
# Use each of these once in the program.
# For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!
# Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

# print(), input(), str(), float(), range(), round(), reverse(), sum()

print(str('27'))
