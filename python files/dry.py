# Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:
# Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
# Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
# Use each of these once in the program.
# For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!
# Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

# The print() function outputs specified text or variables to the console or other output devices
print('The print() function outputs specified text or variables to the console or other output devices')

# The input() function reads a line of text from the user via the keyboard and returns it as a string
hello = input('The input() function reads a line of text from the user via the keyboard and returns it as a string. Try is out: ')
print(hello)

# The len() function
num = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(len(num))

# The range() function in Python generates a sequence of integers from a starting value up to, but not including, an ending value, with an optional step size
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(1, 6)))
print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))

# the help() function in Python is used to get help information about a specified object, module, function, class, or keyword.
