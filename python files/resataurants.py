# Suppose we're building a food delivery app and want to store restaurants' info.

# Create a Restaurant class in a restaurants.py file with the following attributes:
# .name of the type str
# .category of the type str
# .rating of the type float
# .delivery of the type bool
class Restaurant:
    name = ''
    year = 0
    gpa = 0.0
    enrolled = None

# Make these empty/default values for now.

# Nothing should happen when you run the code, because we have yet to use this class. In the next exercise, we will start using it!
