# Let's try a classic Computer Science project: simple calculator program! ðŸ”¢
# Create a calculator.py program and define these five functions:
# add(a, b) that adds two numbers a and b.
# subtract(a, b) that subtracts two numbers a and b
# multiply(a, b) that multiplies two numbers a and b.
# divide(a, b) that divides two numbers a and b.
# exp(a, b) that takes a to the exponent (or power) of b.
# Make sure to return the result in each function definition.
# Test your calculator by calling each function once to make sure that it works!

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

def exp(a, b):
    return a ** b
