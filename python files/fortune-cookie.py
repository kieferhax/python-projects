# Fortune Cookie is a small cookie wafer with a piece of paper inside, called a ‚Äúfortune‚Äù, which is usually a Chinese phrase with translation and a list of lucky numbers.
# They are served in restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. ü•†
# Create a fortune_cookie.py program that gives the user random fortunes.
# Define a function named fortune(). Inside the function, print out a random fortune from the list of options below:
# Don't pursue happiness ‚Äì create it.
# All things are difficult before they are easy.
# The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
# Someone in your life needs a letter from you.
# Don't just think. Act!
# Your heart will skip a beat.
# The fortune you search for is in another cookie.
# Help! I'm being held prisoner in a Chinese bakery!
# Make sure to use the random module's random.randint() and an if/elif/else.
# Then, call the fortune() function three times and see what you get!
