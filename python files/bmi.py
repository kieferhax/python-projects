# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.

# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.

# bmi = mass (kg) / height (m) ** 2

mass = 111.13
height = 1.8542000000000003
bmi = mass / height ** 2

print(f'My current BMI is: {bmi}.')
