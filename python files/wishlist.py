# Many folks, especially around the holidays, carry a wishlist of things they've always wanted. 
# Use Python lists to make your own wishlist!
# Create a list called wishlist and add at least three items to the list. 
# Each item should be a string of something you've always wanted.
wishlish = [
  'Healthy',
  'Wealthy',
  'Wise'

# Print the wishlist to the terminal to see all your wishes in one place!
