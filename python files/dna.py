# DNA is made of the following four pieces:
# Adenine (A)
# Cytosine (C)
# Guanine (G)
# Thymine (T)
# A DNA sequence is made of three-letter combinations of these pieces, such as 'ACG', TCA', and 'CGT'.
# Let's use a Python list to find a specific three-letter combination, starting with the following:
dna_sequence = ['GCT', 'AGC', 'AGG', 'TAA', 'ACT', 'CAT', 'TAT', 'CCC', 'ACG', 'GAA', 'ACC', 'GGA']

# Next, define two variables:
# item_to_find string that is set as a three-letter combination of your choice, with no spaces (e.g. 'TGA' or 'CAT').
# item_found boolean, initialized to False.
item_to_find = 'CAT'
item_found = False

# Loop through each item in the dna_sequence list. Inside, use an if statement to test if a given item is equal to the item_to_find. If so, set item_found to True.
for item in dna_sequence:
    if item == item_to_find:
        item_found = True

# Outside the loop, use an if/else statement to check if item_found is True:
# If so, print something like "Item Found!"
# Else, print something like "Item not found."
if item_found:
    print('Item Found!')
else:
    print('Item not found.')
